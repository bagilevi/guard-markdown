The i40 will act as the new brand ambassador, while at the same time attracting new customers to the brand - both private and fleet. Production began in April with the i40 Wagon first appearing in showrooms from summer 2011, with the i40 Sedan, which debuted at the Barcelona Motorshow on the 12th May, following later in the year.

Hyundai Motor Europe Vice President Allan Rushforth explains that.."The i40 sedan shares the same qualities found in the wagon, including outstanding levels of fuel-efficiency, comfort, and quality, and broadens the appeal of the i40 to buyers in the D-segment."

The i-flow Concept, which the i40 is derived from, brought new ideas and a pioneering form to the traditional European D-segment. The dramatically-sculpted forms of the interior and exterior made for a striking sports sedan, with an athletic stance.
